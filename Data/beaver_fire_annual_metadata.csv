ndwi,"The average normalized difference water index of the polygon, as measured from a cloud-masked mean mosaic of Sentinel2 Level 1c images from June 1 to August 31 of the Measurement_year. =(Green-NIR)/(Green+NIR)"
Measurement_year,The year that NDVI and NDWI measurements were collected from
yrs_post_fire, = Measurement_year - Fire_Year
